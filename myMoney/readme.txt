myMoney
by Turkoid
-----------------------------

I created this addon to mimic the functionality of MoneyFu without depending on Ace or Fubar.  It's lightweight and has some added features that moneyFu didn't like the "all-time" gold tracker.

Configuration is done by editing the lua file and I have no plans on implementing an GUI config.  Most of the variables are self-explanatory. Any questions, suggestions can be posted on the www.wowinterface.com addon page.

/mymoney and /mm are the slash commands
You can right click the frame to unlock it as well.

Thanks for installing this addon and enjoy!
